However, this can also negatively impact\npopulation diversity, complicating the solving of hierarchical problems, which\nfeature multiple layers of complexity. While there have been attempts to\naddress this issue, these solutions are often complicated and prone to bias. To\novercome this, we propose a solution inspired by the Gene Invariant Genetic\nAlgorithm (GIGA), which preserves gene frequencies in the population throughout\nthe process. This technique is tailored to and integrated with the Gene-pool\nOptimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA), resulting in GI-GOMEA.

A novel drift analysis method is then developed to estimate\nhitting probability, where paths are introduced to handle multimodal fitness\nlandscapes.

However, conventional annotation methods heavily\nrely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing\nnon-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these\nchallenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that\nautomates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic\nannotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural\nnetworks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and\nincorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail\nenvironments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach\nover traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator\nlabeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.\nRemarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video\nannotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of\ndetected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process\nfor the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can\nsignificantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection\nenables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,\nproving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey\nanalysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring."}

Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints.

Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene\nimages) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their\nflexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these\nmethods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting\nevery sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance.

Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively\nintegrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the\nAFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale\nfeature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The\nexperimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the\nproposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,\nrobustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features."}

We evaluate 12\nstate-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary\nmodels achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their\nperformance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is\nrequired. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this\nsetting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum\naccuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,\nmulti-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for\nadvancing document understanding research."}

Next, we present an\noverview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the\nsource, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this\nunderstanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling\ntechniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we\nconclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.\nAltogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling\nthe vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature."}

In this paper, we\nintroduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person\nview worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It\nconsists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from\nover 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and\neffective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,\nscene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories.

Ideally, training an\nSAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.\nHowever, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \\emph{dense}), raising\nconcerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In\nthis work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of\ndense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect\nmeaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend\nto form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual\nstream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense\nfeatures in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an\nintrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense\nlatents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,\nentropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and\nprincipal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features\nevolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early\nlayers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented\nsignals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense\nlatents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be\ndismissed as training noise."}

To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding\nSupervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained\nwith relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only\nover the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both\ntextual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In\nthe text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11\ninformation-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding\ntechniques.

However, this assumption often does\nnot hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in\nreal-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily\nLearning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns.

Furthermore, it is challenging for\nmodels to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,\nsuch as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends\nbeyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed\npositional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical\ninformation into vision language models (VLMs).

This analysis\nrequires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing\noccurs at the neuron level.

Addressing these\nlimitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret\ndataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised\nCompression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret\nrepresentation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to\nidentify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze\nactivation patterns.

We then introduce a taxonomy of dense\nlatents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,\nentropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and\nprincipal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features\nevolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early\nlayers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented\nsignals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense\nlatents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be\ndismissed as training noise."}
