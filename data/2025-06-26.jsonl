Among other factors, spray boom\ninstability is one of the major contributors to application errors. Spray\nbooms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and\nmachine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of\nthese booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the\nextent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include\nboom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was\nconducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom\nmovement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was\ndeveloped to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO\nV7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's\nmovements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the\nvertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the\nboom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output. The\nresults showed that the model could detect the target with more than 90 percent\naccuracy, and distance estimates of the target on the boom were within 0.026 m\nof the inclinometer sensor data. This system can quantify the boom movement on\nthe current sprayer and potentially on any other sprayer with minor\nmodifications. The data can be used to make design improvements to make sprayer\nbooms more stable and achieve greater application accuracy."}

In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions\n(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count\ndistributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating\ndense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss\nfunctions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly\nassume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,\nnon-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting\nframework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated\nPoisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional\nregression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,\nenabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count\naccuracy.

The optimal pruning rates for each layer in\nthe network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual\nallocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on\nthe VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the\nResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the\ntop-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network\nFLOPs by 52\\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces\nFLOPs by more than 42\\% with a negligible 0.33\\% drop in top-5 accuracy.

An ansatz of\npsycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields\ninsight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process\nmodel exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to\nfixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a\npredictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive\naccuracy.

Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems\nfor medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and\nsafety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various\nopen-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like\nllama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs\nperformance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs\no4-mini model.

This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently\nresults in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise\nanswer is not feasible.

However, these algorithms\nsometimes return wrong solutions, which become problematic in high-risk domains\nlike medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. One strategy to detect and\nmitigate these errors is the measurement of the uncertainty over neural network\ndecisions. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring\nthe uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a\nsimilar activation vector to the query for each layer. Based on these retrieved\ncases, we propose two new metrics: Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, which\ncapture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers. We\nevaluated our approach in a classification model for two datasets: CIFAR-10 and\nMNIST. The results show that these metrics enhance uncertainty estimation,\nespecially in challenging classification tasks, outperforming softmax-based\nconfidence."}

Materials and\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology\nreports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III\ndatabase. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.\nThree LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor\nplus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.\nPrecision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).\nEfficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer\nremuneration.

A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their\ntypical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs\nhave largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling\nparadigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as\nit's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm\nitself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a\ndecoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or\nAO-AR) and standard AR paradigms.

We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse\nsubjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive\nlanguage, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human\ndisagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results\nshow that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human\nlabel distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also\nachieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming\ntraditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in\ntasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity\npresent in the texts.

In the first module, a feature\nextractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations\nthat are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is\nachieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion\ndiscriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content.

While\nadaptive keyframe extraction mitigates transmission overhead, existing\napproaches often overlook the causal relationships among allocated bandwidth,\nCPU frequency, and user perception, limiting QoE gains. This paper proposes an\nintelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe\nextraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE\nmetric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual\nsensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy.\nThe QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming\n(MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational\nresources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal\nDeep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep\nDeterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By\nleveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by\nvarious actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal\ninference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments\nconducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework\nsignificantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains\nfairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods."}

However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to\nbe effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce\nsemi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available.\nState-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial\nCNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional\nneural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a\nchallenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled\ndata. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to\nfully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image\nsegmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer\nlies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to\nconstruct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image\nmodeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with\nmasked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels\nfrom labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked\ndomain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and\ndevise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the\noriginal and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance.\nWe also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network.

This universal expert captures globally shared\ninformation across all clients and is subsequently distributed to each client\nas the initialization for the next round of model training. The proposed FL\nframework operates in three iterative steps: (1) local model training at each\nclient, (2) cluster-specific model aggregation, and (3) universal expert\ndistillation. This three-step learning paradigm ensures the preservation of\nfine-grained non-IID characteristics while effectively incorporating shared\nknowledge across clusters. Compared to traditional gradient-based aggregation\nmethods, the distillation-based model aggregation introduces greater\nflexibility in handling model heterogeneity and reduces conflicts among\ncluster-specific experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of the proposed method across various scenarios,\nhighlighting its potential to advance the state of CFL by balancing\npersonalized and shared knowledge more effectively."}

Counterfactual\nself-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the\nmodel's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in\nthe training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be\naffected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in\nparticular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization\ntreating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into\naccount how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a\nsmall language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training\nsamples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking\nat self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with\nmemorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces\nself-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We\nobserve similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the\ninfluence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.\nOur findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across\ntraining data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by\nself-influence alone."}

In this work, we formalise the problem of\nproviding recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We\npropose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be\nconsidered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and\nrecourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six\ndesirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose\na novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs\nunder MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to\nexplicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding\nprediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to\nresolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is\nparametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the\nspecification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further\ncustomisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we\ncharacterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different\nargumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of\nour method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)"}

This modular and scalable design enables complex\ndiagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We\nevaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional\ndiagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013\ndiseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15\nmethods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other\nagentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing\nthe second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79\npercentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at\nRecall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of\nreasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore,\nthe DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application\nhttp://raredx.cn/doctor."}

However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects.

Previous work adopts\nthe split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of\nadmissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often\ncontain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address\nthis, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that\ncalibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer\nper question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical\nerror rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as\nClopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error\nrate (i.e., FDR).

Despite promising results\nwere achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene\nevolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore\nperform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a\nrelatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based\npartition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within\ntwo stages. For the ``partition\" stage, a whole event proposal is split into\nshort video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization\"\nstage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each\nsegment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We\nparticularly focus on the ``summarization\" stage, and propose a framework that\neffectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.\nWe achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and\nlearning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues.
