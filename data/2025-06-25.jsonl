Recent studies have\nshown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to\nthe limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching\nproblem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In\nthis paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by\nintroducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger\nconstraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other\nstate-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100,\nImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of\nTRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape\nvisualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can\neffectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape,\nthereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical\ninterpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results\nof Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics\ninside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process,\nrevealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher\ninformation progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying\nregularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to\nlearn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading\nto significant improvements in model generalization.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses\nthe semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion\nmodels for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework\nintroduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that\ndynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and\nobject-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)\nthat iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise\nsegmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general\nvision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD\nenables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature\ninteraction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,\nRefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms\nexisting methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks.

This study evaluates\nthe performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting\nhydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We\nintroduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent\nrepresentations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables.

We first demonstrate that in the\ntraditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic\nprediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions.

Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel\nSynthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance\nchanges for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:\nWe used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),\na knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With\nthese, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates\non real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated\nretrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using\nthe R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC\nalgorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO\n(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8\nchange, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict\npost-deployment performance.

However, this subjective\nevaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer\ninsights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This\npaper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD\nmotor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant\nfeatures are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence\neffect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and\nclinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.\nPrincipal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based\nfeatures corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis\nhas allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect\nand hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to\ntrain machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society\nUnified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.\nCompared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy\nin MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable\nquantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics.

As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is\nestimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This\napproach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to\nimproved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are\ninherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question\narises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting\nat the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk\nminimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term\novertuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical\nrelevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML\nliterature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it\nfrom related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale\nreanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of\novertuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously\nassumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,\novertuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse\ngeneralization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further\nanalyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset\nsize, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss\nmitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of\novertuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further\nmitigation strategies should be studied."}

This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence.

This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating\nhow e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can\nenable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of\npreserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset,\nwe train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a\nHoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's\ninequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable\nconfidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable\nperformance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by\nreducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly\navailable."}

This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence.

In addition, we propose an innovative\ndetection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal\ninformation with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'\nability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments\nconducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks."}

Under aggressive\n4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10\nbenchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%\ntraining overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis\n(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally\naltering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not\ninherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way\nfor more efficient LLM deployment.
