Second, we\nintroduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch\nfor radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch\nfor vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features,\nP2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art\napproaches. Code and pretrained models will be made available at:\nhttps://github.com/HaitianWang/P2MFDS-A-Privacy-Preserving-Multimodal-Fall-Detection-Network-for-Elderly-Individuals-in-Bathroom."}

The\nsystem effectively decomposes complex claims, retrieves reliable evidence from\ntrusted sources, and generates transparent explanations for verification\ndecisions. Our approach contributes to the growing field of automated\nfact-checking by providing a more accurate, efficient, and transparent\nverification methodology that aligns with human fact-checking practices while\nmaintaining scalability for real-world applications.

Yet existing 3D-aware LLMs act as black boxes: they output\nbounding boxes or textual answers without revealing how those decisions are\nmade, and they still rely on pre-trained 3D detectors to supply object\nproposals. We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to\nreason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by\npairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding\npipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video\nand select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the\nsubsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D\nbounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce\npixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby\neliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine\ngeometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question\nanswering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training\npipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D\npoint-wise labels. Scene-R1 surpasses existing open-vocabulary baselines on\nmultiple datasets, while delivering transparent, step-by-step rationales.

In this\npaper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these\nlimitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling\nhuman-like behavior.

The\nscore matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for\nunderstanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain\nplausible while differing significantly from their training images. In\nparticular, as explained in (Kamb \\& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,\n(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we\nwould only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.\nHowever, as shown by Kamb \\& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the\nscore is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself\n(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples\nthat globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise\n`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role\nof self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in\nthis direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose\nscore is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that\nour theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent\narrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and\nwe verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset."}

The Cooperative\nEvasion and Formation Coverage (CEFC) task, where the UAV swarm aims to\nmaximize formation coverage across multiple target zones while collaboratively\nevading predators, belongs to one of the most challenging issues in MC-PEG,\nespecially under communication-limited constraints. This multifaceted problem,\nwhich intertwines responses to obstacles, adversaries, target zones, and\nformation dynamics, brings up significant high-dimensional complications in\nlocating a solution. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework\n(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),\nwhich delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a\nlow-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.\nSpecifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent\nreinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication\n(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish\nconsensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.\nMeanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal\npolicy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level\ncontrol.

However, these labeled\nsupport samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity\ncomparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space\nitself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a\nseries of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning\nmethods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning\n(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and\nAugmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT).

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}

Finally, we propose to\nleverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel\nconvolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce\nparameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We\nconduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N\nimproves mAP by 3.0\\% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5\\% over YOLOv12-N. The code and\nmodels of our YOLOv13 model are available at:\nhttps://github.com/iMoonLab/yolov13."}

In\norder to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under\nundesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,\nit is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low\nframe rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based\nforeground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures\nscattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex\noptimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general\nfeatures, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of\nnoise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and\ngeneral features to accurately separate the components from various types of\nnoise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization\nproblem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex\nsubproblems by newly established algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method over existing methods using two types of degraded\nvideos: infrared and microscope videos."}

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data.

In this work, we propose a stain\nnormalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color\ndiscrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and\nvector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the\ntarget color features, and decoding the stained structure features to\nnormalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by\ndifferent images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this\nassumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color\nfeatures will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention\nmechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color\n(decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of\nstain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to\nselect a template from a given dataset.

Specifically, we start with the observation that\nwhen trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the\nstrategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of\nBayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on\nthe set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches\nthe underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from\ncognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal\nadaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical\nBayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token\npredictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under\nthis framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior\nprobability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a\nposterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework\ndraws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make\nexplicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:\nbeyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing\na strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL\nphenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend\nin the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.\nOverall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL\ngrounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity."}

To\nmitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to\nreduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear\nwhether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model.\nTherefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which\naims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the\ngoal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework\nthat learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise\ncan trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level\nperturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic\nembedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To\nimprove stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes\nthe difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring\nthe attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can\neffectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned\nnoise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples\ncan reveal forgotten content in unseen images.

To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental\nTraining Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we\nconstructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,\nwhich leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original\ndata into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental\nTraining Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by\nperforming Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT\ndata. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards\non the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training\non the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The\nresulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4\naddresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture\ncomplex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture\nspace of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation\nexperiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the\nreasoning ability of 1B SVLM.

We propose a categorisation\nof main approaches to GAN-based LDI, highlight strengths and limitations of\nmethods, identify key research trends, and provide promising future directions.\nOur findings indicate that while GANs show great potential for LDI to improve\nusability and quality of longitudinal data for tasks like LDC, there is need\nfor more versatile approaches that can handle the wider spectrum of challenges\npresented by longitudinal data with missing values. By synthesising current\nknowledge and identifying critical research gaps, this survey aims to guide\nfuture research efforts in developing more effective GAN-based solutions to\naddress LDC challenges."}

However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field\noverwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To\nfulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,\nefficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and\ndata quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ\nlayer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework\naims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a\ncase study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that\npartially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8\nobject detection task performance.

Experiments on long-context\nbenchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%\nwith 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache\nquantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with\nminimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context\nlength on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

Recent research demonstrates\nthat large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series\nforecasting.

To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based\ntime series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and\ncross-modal semantic alignment.

Creating a single platform for\nstandardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of\nbalancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of\nvarious disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully\nenable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly\nmultidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge\nwith sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational\nexpertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas\nplatform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific\ndomains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven\nprogress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy\n(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform\nthat balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data\nacross multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows\nusing customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI\nresearch copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and\nresearch automation. Already deployed in laboratories across all four schools\nof Westlake University, Airalogy has the potential to accelerate and automate\nscientific innovation in universities, industry, and the global research\ncommunity-ultimately benefiting humanity as a whole."}

To address the\nchallenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of\ngenerating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of\nthe reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct\nanswer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free\nframework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains.

To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions.

To address these challenges, we\npropose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both\nthe stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first\nderives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation\nlearning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for\nrobust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a\nDRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the\ndiversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we\nfurther introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces\nreliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms\nof collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in\ncases where the expert policy is sub-optimal."}

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}

In addition, we apply federated learning in two\nexemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical\ncompanies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture\nactivity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification\nof a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models\njointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy\nthan models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform\nsimilarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated\nlearning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical\nengineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for\nfuture industrial applications."}

Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review\nmethodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024\ninvestigating bias mitigation strategies.

The concept of\nrevocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme\nis revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme\nrevoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the\nindividual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition\npower. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust\nrevocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and\ntraining set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face\nmatcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)\nstrongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power\nextends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have\nthe same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the\nmodels can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The\nbiometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible\nthat the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is\ntypically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different\npersons.

To address these challenges, we\nevaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component\ntasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of\ntask-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep\nlearning models -- an \"information saturation bottleneck\" -- where networks\nfail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during\ntraining. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during\npretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and\nperform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training\nmixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this\nphenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data\ndistribution or ordering affect the features that current representation\nlearning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely\non large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific\ntraining, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a\npotential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically,\npresent existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards\naddressing this challenge."}

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}

While\nwritten GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback\nbased on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,\ntranscription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically\nfollow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),\ndisfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation\nacross modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and\nfeedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when\ndeveloping these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are\ncompared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E\nsystems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an\nautomatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data\nfrom 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,\nadditional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.\nCandidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving\nperformance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate\nof the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of\nthis feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to\nremove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors.\nFinally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation\napproach, to exclude low-confidence edits.

To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions.

In\nthis work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely\nfrom scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality\ntext generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a\nbase model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that\nfacilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support\nthis, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved\nlength control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental\nevaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,\nconsistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,\nachieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and\nArena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and\nQwen3-235B.

Additionally,\nthe intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further\nexacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data\npoints in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball\ncomputing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of\ngranular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from\ncoarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a\ndensity consistency measurement.

Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on\n''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic\nlong-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT\ndata, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and\nconsistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In\nthis work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely\nfrom scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality\ntext generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a\nbase model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that\nfacilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support\nthis, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved\nlength control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental\nevaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,\nconsistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,\nachieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and\nArena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and\nQwen3-235B.
