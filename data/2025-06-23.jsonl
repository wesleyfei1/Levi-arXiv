While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses.

We analyze and benchmark\nour algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT\ninstances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find\nthat DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including\nthe complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the\nhardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors.\nThe essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure\nbeyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape\nlocal minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for\ngeneralization to other optimization problems."}

Yet, its practical\napplication is often hindered by reliance on external verifiers or a lack of\noptimization for realistic computational constraints. We propose DynScaling,\nwhich addresses these limitations through two primary innovations: an\nintegrated parallel-sequential sampling strategy and a bandit-based dynamic\nbudget allocation framework. The integrated sampling strategy unifies parallel\nand sequential sampling by constructing synthetic sequential reasoning chains\nfrom initially independent parallel responses, promoting diverse and coherent\nreasoning trajectories. The dynamic budget allocation framework formulates the\nallocation of computational resources as a multi-armed bandit problem,\nadaptively distributing the inference budget across queries based on the\nuncertainty of previously sampled responses, thereby maximizing computational\nefficiency. By combining these components, DynScaling effectively improves LLM\nperformance under practical resource constraints without the need for external\nverifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that DynScaling consistently\nsurpasses existing verifier-free inference scaling baselines in both task\nperformance and computational cost."}

Because of its\nunidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous\nstates and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision\nmethods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward\nscan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a\nfull receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load,\neroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To\neliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM\nblock that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward\nselective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on\nLBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan\ndirections every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra\nbackward sweeps.

If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure\nof language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)\ntrained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures\nembedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences\nfor causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading\nto degraded performance, especially in Chinese.

This approach enables\nself-supervised learning on sequential current, voltage, and other\ncharge-discharge cycle data, yielding distributionally robust, context-aware\ntemporal embeddings. We then concatenate these embeddings with battery metadata\nand feed them into a downstream classifier for accurate fault classification.\nExperimental results on a large-scale real-world dataset show that models\ninitialized with our pretrained parameters significantly improve both\nrepresentation quality and classification accuracy, achieving an AUROC of 0.945\nand substantially outperforming existing approaches. These findings validate\nthe effectiveness of BERT-style pretraining for time-series fault detection."}

In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation\n(DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform\nFGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we\ndesign Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the\npre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that\nare helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context\nAdaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation\nwithout modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using\nthese adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training.\nAdditionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose\nDiscrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in\nthe object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge\ndistillation mechanism.

While\nrecent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient\nfacial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical\nand privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable\nmodels across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a\nnovel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving\nessential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a\npretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics\nof real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains\ndiagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients'\nidentities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population\npre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a\nconditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input\nspace of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to\nfine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including\nquantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that\nSafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant\nfacial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage. Our evaluations also show\nthat SafeTriage provides robust privacy protection while maintaining diagnostic\naccuracy, offering a secure and ethically sound foundation for data sharing and\nAI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders."}

This is because they can encode information from more training samples\nwhile minimizing the user's token usage, leaving more space in the context\nwindow for task-specific input. However, soft prompts are tightly coupled to\nthe LLM they are tuned on, limiting their generalization to other LLMs. This\nconstraint is particularly problematic for efficiency and privacy: (1) tuning\nprompts on each LLM incurs high computational costs, especially as LLMs\ncontinue to grow in size.

If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure\nof language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)\ntrained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures\nembedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences\nfor causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading\nto degraded performance, especially in Chinese.

Over the course of training, the agent is tasked with\nminimising the distance to the top-ranked goal in a learned embedding space,\nwhich is trained on unlabelled visual data.

To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable\nAttention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping\narbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer\nmodels. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector,\ncalculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the\nTopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module.

MTL typically accomplishes this goal by\nlearning a shared representation that captures common structure among the tasks\nby embedding data from all tasks into a common feature space. Despite being\ndesigned to be the smallest unit of shared information necessary to effectively\nlearn patterns across multiple tasks, these shared representations can\ninadvertently leak sensitive information about the particular tasks they were\ntrained on.\n  In this work, we investigate what information is revealed by the shared\nrepresentations through the lens of inference attacks. Towards this, we propose\na novel, black-box task-inference threat model where the adversary, given the\nembedding vectors produced by querying the shared representation on samples\nfrom a particular task, aims to determine whether that task was present when\ntraining the shared representation. We develop efficient, purely black-box\nattacks on machine learning models that exploit the dependencies between\nembeddings from the same task without requiring shadow models or labeled\nreference data.

A well-generalized feature extractor on the base classes (many\nexamples and many classes) is learned, and then fixed during incremental\nlearning.

Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks.

We find that two memory- and\ncompute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1)\ncolumn-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of\nplain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only\nto the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance\ncompetitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights,\nwe propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new\noptimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where\ncolumn normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output\ndimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the\nperformance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also\nconsistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and\nAPOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory\nconstraints. For the LLaMA 7B model, SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethod APOLLO in terms of both perplexity and memory consumption. In addition,\nour method serves as a minimalist baseline for more sophisticated optimizer\ndesign."}

It has recently attracted surging\nacademic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although\nthere are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still\nhave limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different\nlevels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little\ndiscussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the\ngap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely\nGeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and\nprovide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be\nable to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate\nwith vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability\nto reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge. In\nthis work, we establish a benchmark for GeoGuess by introducing a specially\ncurated dataset GeoExplain which consists of\npanoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples.

But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems.

But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality.

The reasoning performance is determined\nby an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths.\nEventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with\nranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum\nlearning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable\nreasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1,\ntrained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning\nbenchmarks.

First,\nthe communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a\ntrusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and\nrepresented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures\ntrust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison\nwith data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution,\nthe collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as\ntask completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with\nan ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model,\nconsisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to\nlearn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.\nFinally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is\ncalculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot.

While keeping the LLM\nparameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of\nharmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through\nextensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the\nrobustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful\nprompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\\%$.\nResults also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs\nupto $100\\%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our\nfindings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future\ninvestigations into designing variable system prompts."}

However, the privacy risks associated\nwith captured imagery remain a major concern, as such data can be misused for\nidentity theft, profiling, or unauthorized commercial purposes. While\ntraditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied\nto mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals\ncan still be tracked using other features such as their clothing.

SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal\ndrop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop\nobserved in SOTA methods.This superior performance extends across various types\nof corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0%\nvs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training,\nsupervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses\nself-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random\nnetworks. Moreover,unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization\nfor each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous\nadaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust\nresults, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online,\nadapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2\ndemonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a\nnew generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future."}

Each LLM evaluates sliding\nwindows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions,\ngenerating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this\nlanguage-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match\nevents, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional\nvideo-based methods for action spotting."}

Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D\nGaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable\nattributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve\nhigh-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a\nmotion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints,\nincluding contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field\nalignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part\ncollisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving\nmotion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable\nparts."}
